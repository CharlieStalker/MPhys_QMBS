	abstract = {Recent discovery of persistent revivals in quantum simulators based on Rydberg atoms have pointed to the existence of a new type of dynamical behavior that challenged the conventional paradigms of integrability and thermalization. This novel collective effect has been named quantum many-body scars by analogy with weak ergodicity breaking of a single particle inside a stadium billiard. In this overview, we provide a pedagogical introduction to quantum many-body scars and highlight the newly emerged connections with the semiclassical quantization of many-body systems. We discuss the relation between scars and more general routes towards weak violations of ergodicity due to "embedded" algebras and non-thermal eigenstates, and highlight possible applications of scars in quantum technology.},

	abstract = {Following the recent observation of wave function revivals in large Rydberg atom quantum simulators, much effort has focused on understanding the emergence of many-body scars in non-integrable quantum systems. Here we explore the origin of scarred wavefunction revivals in a family of models obtained by deforming the graph adjacency matrix of the PXP model - the effective model of Rydberg atoms in the strong Rydberg blockade regime. We consider deformations that either enhance the Rydberg constraint, ultimately resulting in an effective tight-binding model of two hypercubes joined at a single vertex, or relax the constraint until reaching the free spin-1/2 model. In the former case, we argue that the model of two joined hypercubes captures the essential features of many-body scarring present in the PXP model. On the other hand, relaxing the constraint leads to a sequence of new scarred models, some with more robust scarring signatures than the PXP model, as can be understood from the graph-theoretic viewpoint. Our results shed light on the nature of scarring in the PXP model by identifying its simple parent model, while also highlighting its distinction from the free-spin precession.},

	abstract = {Certain wave functions of non-interacting quantum chaotic systems can exhibit "scars" in the fabric of their real-space density profile. Quantum scarred wave functions concentrate in the vicinity of unstable periodic classical trajectories. We introduce the notion of many-body quantum scars which reflect the existence of a subset of special many-body eigenstates concentrated in certain parts of the Hilbert space. We demonstrate the existence of scars in the Fibonacci chain -- the one- dimensional model with a constrained local Hilbert space realized in the 51 Rydberg atom quantum simulator [H. Bernien et al., arXiv:1707.04344]. The quantum scarred eigenstates are embedded throughout the thermalizing many-body spectrum, but surprisingly lead to direct experimental signatures such as robust oscillations following a quench from a charge-density wave state found in experiment. We develop a model based on a single particle hopping on the Hilbert space graph, which quantitatively captures the scarred wave functions up to large systems of L = 32 atoms. Our results suggest that scarred many-body bands give rise to a new universality class of quantum dynamics, which opens up opportunities for creating and manipulating novel states with long-lived coherence in systems that are now amenable to experimental study.},

Berry's conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy eigenfunctions behave as if they were gaussian random variables. We review the existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture predicts a Maxwell--Boltzmann, Bose--Einstein, or Fermi--Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this phenomenon \{{\textbackslash}it eigenstate thermalization\}. We show that a generic initial state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as \$O({\textbackslash}hbar/{\textbackslash}Delta)t{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, where \${\textbackslash}Delta\$ is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is needed. We argue that these results constitute a new foundation for quantum statistical mechanics.},

Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble. A more detailed statement of this is named the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.},

We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary.

However, the existing experimental realizations of QMBS are based on systems with specific kinetic constrains. Here we experimentally realize a distinct kind of QMBS by approximately decoupling a part of the many-body Hilbert space in the computational basis. Utilizing a programmable superconducting processor with 30 qubits and tunable couplings, we realize Hilbert space scarring in a non-constrained model in different geometries, including a linear chain and quasi-one-dimensional comb geometry. By reconstructing the full quantum state through quantum state tomography on four-qubit subsystems, we provide strong evidence for QMBS states by measuring qubit population dynamics, quantum fidelity and entanglement entropy after a quench from initial unentangled states. Our experimental findings broaden the realm of scarring mechanisms and identify correlations in QMBS states for quantum technology applications.},

A salient feature of some quantum many-body scars is their subvolume bipartite entanglement entropy. In this Letter, we demonstrate that such exact many-body scars also possess extensive multipartite entanglement structure if they stem from an su(2) spectrum generating algebra. We show this analytically, through scaling of the quantum Fisher information, which is found to be superextensive for exact scarred eigenstates in contrast to generic thermal states. Furthermore, we numerically study signatures of multipartite entanglement in the PXP model of Rydberg atoms, showing that extensive quantum Fisher information density can be generated dynamically by performing a global quench experiment. Our results identify a rich multipartite correlation structure of scarred states with significant potential as a resource in quantum enhanced metrology.},

	abstract = {Based on the PXP model adapted for Rydberg-blockaded chains, we investigate dynamics of topological domain walls between different quantum many-body scar states of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_2\$ symmetry. It is found that, the domain walls not only possess oscillating features of scars but also manifest longstanding bipartite entanglement with exactly unchanged flip-flop phase difference, suggesting their potential as quantum information resource. A periodically driven field is exerted and the high-frequency drive gives rise to a phase transition from prethermalization to Floquet localization. In order to investigate the stability of domain walls acting as information carriers, we further simulate the collision between them and find negligible influence on each other. Subsequently, the quench dynamics with domain walls reveals exotic physics and applicable potentials of nonthermalized scar states.},

	abstract = {In this Letter we pose the question of whether a many-body quantum system with a full set of conserved quantities can relax to an equilibrium state, and, if it can, what the properties of such a state are. We confirm the relaxation hypothesis through an ab initio numerical investigation of the dynamics of hard-core bosons on a one-dimensional lattice. Further, a natural extension of the Gibbs ensemble to integrable systems results in a theory that is able to predict the mean values of physical observables after relaxation. Finally, we show that our generalized equilibrium carries more memory of the initial conditions than the usual thermodynamic one. This effect may have many experimental consequences, some of which have already been observed in the recent experiment on the nonequilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional hard-core bosons in a harmonic potential [T. Kinoshita et al., Nature (London) 440, 900 (2006)].},

	abstract = {We review some recent developments in the statistical mechanics of isolated quantum systems. We provide a brief introduction to quantum thermalization, paying particular attention to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and the resulting single-eigenstate statistical mechanics. We then focus on a class of systems that fail to quantum thermalize and whose eigenstates violate the ETH: These are the many-body Anderson-localized systems; their long-time properties are not captured by the conventional ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics. These systems can forever locally remember information about their local initial conditions and are thus of interest for possibilities of storing quantum information. We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase. Single-eigenstate statistical mechanics within the MBL phase reveal dynamically stable ordered phases, and phase transitions among them, that are invisible to equilibrium statistical mechanics and can occur at high energy and low spatial dimensionality, where equilibrium ordering is forbidden.},

@article{Abanin2019,
abstract = {Thermalizing quantum systems are conventionally described by statistical mechanics at equilibrium. However, not all systems fall into this category, with many-body localization providing a generic mechanism for thermalization to fail in strongly disordered systems. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators at nonzero temperature, which do not thermalize and therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. This Colloquium reviews recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and nonequilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of quasilocal integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on quasilocal integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore, MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. An outline is given of the current theoretical understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic phases and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition. Experimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well isolated from an external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL phase. Recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in which different signatures of many-body localization have been observed, are reviewed. This Colloquium concludes by listing outstanding challenges and promising future research directions.},
