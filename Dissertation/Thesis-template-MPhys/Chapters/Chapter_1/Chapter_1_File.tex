\chapter{Introduction}

With the recent experimental advancements allowing for the study of the quantum mechanics of individual atoms in isolated many-body systems there has been an increasing interest in describing the fundamental actions of these small systems. In particular we are interested in a phenomena called Quantum Many-Body Scarring, wherein certain non-equilibrium eigenstates show unexpected periodic revivals. These revivals provide an intriguing avenue of research with potential applications such as increasing the availability of long lasting quantum states in order to preserve quantum information within fields such as quantum information or quantum metrology.
Within this paper we explore the Spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XY model within a dimerized model constructed with tunable couplings inspired by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model of polyacetylene. 

In particular we explore the fidelity and entanglement properties of both experimentally shown scarred states and eigenvectors found by exact diagonalization of the system.
